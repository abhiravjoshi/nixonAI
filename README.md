Richard Nixon Voice AI
Goals:
1) With OpenAI, use Whisper to transcribe audio that someone says into a microphone. Then from whatever's transcribed, perform TTS, utilizing training data based off of Nixon's interview
    a) Initially make a working product with pre-recorded wav or mp3 files
    b) Then make a version that takes a recording
2) Next step: have any text output comes out of ChatGPT response to be spoken in Nixon voice (using CoquiTTS)
3) Final step: take in a bunch of text training from Nixon's books / speeches etc. then the AI model would have to respond like its Nixon
